# Parallel variables

=begin
Instead of
a = 10
b = 20
c = 30
we can use parallel variable assignment
=end

# Called as parallel variable assignment
a, b, c = 10, 20, 30

# Instead of

# p a
# p b
# p c

# We can use
p a, b, c

#Swapping values
a = 10
b = 10

# We can swap values of variables like this
a, b = b, a
