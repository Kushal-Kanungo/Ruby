# 1. Constants in the module should be written in All Upper Case
# 2. Access module methods with (.) operator
# 3. Access module constants with (::) symbol
# 4. :: scope resolution operator
# 5. Constants and methods mixed into class do not need to be prefixed with module name

# ? What is mixin ?
# todo: Mixin is a module that injects addtional behaviours to the class

# * Mixins allows us to mimic inheritance from more than one class

# ? Why mixin ?
# todo: Because ruby is a single inheritance language and real life problems are much complex to fit into this.
